It’s hard to pinpoint an exact inflection point, but around that time I started noticing people around me getting information more from internet sources rather than from books, magazines, and newspapers.

The entire experience felt like the alpha release of a cool, low-risk, tech product that I could experiment with.

<!----><!--]--><!--[--><!----><p>To put it simply, blockchains allow individuals to cooperate with others they don’t trust by placing trust in the network and cryptographic algorithms securing the data. This as an incredible engineering feat and certainly has valuable and appropriate use cases. But just as driving an armored vehicle with a motorcade is overkill and cost / energy inefficient for most transit scenarios, moving all our applications onto blockchain-powered platforms is not going to solve any real problems while only creating more problems. For example, how is a blockchain-powered social media platform going to be any better at solving harassment problems, especially if every single post gets written permanently on-chain? Without any cooperation with legally enforceable regulations, how are so called “smart contracts” going to provide any jurisdiction over the real world?</p>
<!----><!--]--><!--[--><!----><p>Additionally, blockchain protocols are built with mistrust as a default state, which means a lot of redundant energy is spent verifying every single transaction, which is why cryptocurrencies consume exorbitant amounts of energy in return for little actual performance, not to mention the extra amount of engineering required to build, deploy, and support something on the blockchain.</p>
