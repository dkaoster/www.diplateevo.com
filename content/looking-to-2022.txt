When I started this blog back in high school, a classmate of mine kindly gave me access to his web host and a WordPress sandbox that I could do whatever I wanted with. I started hacking my way around HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, finding a way to break this website almost weekly and trying out as many WordPress plugins and themes as I possibly could. I flouted my parents' computer use curfew by waking up at six in the morning in order to play with my website (or computer games), and even the name "diplateevo" came out of an experimental mindset of rearranging random letters until I got something unique.

I started writing regularly about my personal life, education, technology, and startups, racking up a couple hundred pageviews a day and soon outgrowing my borrowed web host. After a few conversations with my father, he agreed to pay for my first two years on dreamhost, and I started thinking about all the different possibilities for my little corner of the internet.

I wrote as much as I could about things I was learning throughout college, religiously keeping this website up-to-date and even trying different platforms such as YouTube.

It's a little amusing to me that now in 2022, I'm trying to simplify this website as much as possible.
