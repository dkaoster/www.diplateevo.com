I spend my days crunching data and visualizing news stories for the web and mobile devices, currently as a freelancer while pursuing my master's in [Cartography and Geographic Information Systems](https://geography.wisc.edu/gis/onlinemasters/) at the University of Wisconsin. Previously, I was a senior graphics engineer for [Commonwealth Magazine](https://www.cw.com.tw/graphics/) and frontend engineer for the New York Times.

I'm motivated by the idea that digital mediums can help readers better understand complex challenges facing societies today. In addition, I believe that newsrooms are among the most conducive environments to experimentation, development, and creativity.

More broadly, Iâ€™m interested in the interplay of technology, maps, politics, journalism, international relations, democracy, and education. My spare time is spent eating noodles, surfing, reading, and traveling.
