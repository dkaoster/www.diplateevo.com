I spend my days crunching data and visualizing news stories for the web and mobile devices, currently for Commonwealth Magazine. Previously, I was a frontend engineer for the New York Times and The News Lens.

I'm motivated by the idea that digital mediums can help readers better understand complex challenges facing societies today. In addition, I believe that newsrooms are among the most conducive environments to experimentation, development, and creativity.

More broadly, Iâ€™m interested in the interplay of technology, politics, journalism, international relations, democracy, and education. My spare time is spent eating noodles, surfing, reading, and traveling.
