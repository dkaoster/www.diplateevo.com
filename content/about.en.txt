I spend my days visualizing news stories for the web and mobile devices, currently for Commonwealth Magazine. Previously, I worked for the New York Times by rebuilding the homepage, running machine learning algorithms for news recommendations, and contributing to digital security projects.

I'm motivated by the belief that when used properly, digital mediums can help readers better understand the complex problems facing societies today. In addition, I believe that newsrooms are among the most conducive environments to experimentation, development, and creativity.

More broadly, Iâ€™m interested in the interplay of technology, politics, journalism, international relations, democracy, and education. My spare time is spent eating noodles, surfing, reading, and traveling.
