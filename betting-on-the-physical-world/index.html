    <!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>In the past two years, significant hype in the technology industry has centered around two main developments: crypto and virtual reality. With skyrocketing inflation, political unrest, racism, violence, climate change, a pandemic, wars, and so much more, people around the world are understandably disillusioned with our societal machinery and are looking for anything to come along and disrupt the status quo. Both crypto and virtual reality represent visions of leaving behind the world as we know it and creating some future that is less dependent on or completely independent from existing political, cultural, and physical systems.</p>

Moving back to the states after nearly three years abroad, it’s hard to describe how different things feel now, even though much of my immediate hometown feels, on the surface, identical to how I left it.

<!-- HTML_TAG_END --><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>In the past few years, I’ve examined issues such as climate change, elections, and more from the perspective of a data journalist, crunching numbers and making graphics to better understand news events.

Maybe the way that we’ve oriented our ambitions and careers haven’t done much to address our physical world with human-centered solutions. No matter how much we improve and advance our technology, digital tools, and internet societies, our physical world will continue to be the most important investment in our future.
