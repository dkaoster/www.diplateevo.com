            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt="Leaving News" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2025/01/wapo-newsroom.jpg" width="100%"><p>Ever since graduating in 2016, I’ve worked for four newsrooms and media-adjacent organizations in two different countries and languages. I’ve given talks at conferences, universities, and podcasts. Working in newsrooms always presented challenges that were both difficult and fulfilling, and among other things inspired me to pursue my master’s degree in cartography and GIS.</p><p>Last Friday was my last day at the Washington Post. Amidst all the challenges facing the Washington Post and the media at large, I submitted my resignation and will be starting a new job in a new industry. Skip to the bottom if you want to know where I’ll be going, but first I need to get some catharsis out of the way.</p><p>I’ve always been drawn to newsrooms because I’ve strongly believed that newsrooms are among the most fertile environments for innovation and creative engineering. There’s nothing quite like working technology in a newsroom, largely because the constraints of the news cycle leads to developing technology that is scrappy, effective, experimental, and published at scale. It’s why tools such as D3 and Svelte were developed in news organizations.</p><p>Ever since Snowfall was published in 2012, every year there are more and more creative approaches to digital reporting, including elections results coverage, which is what I have spent the past two years working on at The Washington Post. I’ll eventually publish something more specific to the work accomplished in the 2024 election cycle, but I honestly feel that in 2024 we reached a peak elections coverage after taking everything we’ve learned since starting digital elections coverage.</p><p>But beyond the satisfaction of seeing projects go live, one of the best parts of working in news organizations is the people that you meet along the way. Working on digital storytelling innovations is rarely a career that one accidentally falls into or is advertised at the top of any “most prestigious careers” list. It’s a job that almost everyone working in actively and specifically seeks out, and also one that attracts a huge diversity of interesting, creative, and technical people who chose to pursue this career for reasons other than money.</p><p>I’ve met so many people along the way, whether as colleagues I interacted with daily, people I’ve met at conferences, or people who have simply reached out to me on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Email. Like journalists, every single technologist working with newsrooms have had wildly diverse opinions, approaches, and perspectives leading to insanely creative works and results.</p><p>So why am I leaving what I once considered to be a dream job in media? The primary reason is that news organizations are no longer what they were a decade ago. The support for and investment in creative, digital, and data driven storytelling is no longer as strong as it once was, with many news executives pivoting to a dubious pursuit of “AI”, ignoring the legacy and foundational cornerstones of journalism that have built the news organizations of the past.</p><p>Additionally, the culture of empowering employees to openly experiment and innovate has changed into a top-down approach where executives no longer seem to trust employees to build things that matter. Gone are the days of hackathons, open source, 20% time, and intern programs that made a positive difference on people like myself when I was starting out in my career.</p><p>To put it bluntly, the trend of declining local newsrooms across America has really begun to impact even the strongest news organizations that have survived up to this point, and the decisions being made at the top of these organizations are only contributing to their demise.</p><p>I’ve wrestled with my personal responsibility in this for a long time now. Given my experience and background, I would be well positioned to fight to keep the environments that helped me grow as a news developer and build toward when things are once again better. But if I’m honest with myself, I’ve become a little burnt out on news, jaded by all the disappointments over the past few years, and really craving a chance to do something completely different.</p><p>For that, I will be starting at Rivian in a couple of weeks. Although I never pictured myself working in automotive, conversations I had throughout the interview process have certainly piqued my interest, and I’m excited to bring my experience into a new industry. It feels bittersweet leaving the news industry, especially at a time like this, but I’m also looking forward to having the opportunity to try something new.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt="2024 Photoessay: Rekindling the Inner Child" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-1.jpg" width="100%"><p>2024 was a special year, and not just because I entered my fourth decade of life, but also my third year living in the desert. For the past three years, Tucson has served as somewhat of an oasis for me. A place where few distractions come out to bother me, allowing me to focus fully on my work, relationships that matter, and space to explore interests both new and old. But I’ve also done a significant amount of travel in 2024: trips to California, Hawaii, Washington DC, and New York punctuated the year, giving me moments of execution and celebration when needed.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Chinese New Year Spread" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-2.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>Food was also a theme of this year, as it is every year. Being away from large urban cultural centers like the bay area, Los Angeles, or Taipei, most meals dining out ended in something to the effect of “you’re asking me to pay this much for food I can make better myself?” Luckily I found myself in the company of friends willing to experiment in the kitchen, making all sorts of gourmet delectables out of the sheer fact that we had no alternatives readily accessible. Chinese new year, random gatherings to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKUrnDWeRIc">make the quintessential xiaolongbao</a>, and any excuse to eat had us pulling the flour out of the cupboard or browsing facebook marketplace for kitchen aids.</p><div class="image-wrap cover svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Nightfall over NYC" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-3.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>In March, I stepped off the Amtrak in Penn Station to find myself back navigating the underworld of New York City, a place I called home for three years fresh out of college but hadn’t been back to in over five years. Rushing to buy a new MetroCard and pulling the ideal swipe speed out of deep recesses of my muscle memory, I noticed our train on the platform getting ready to depart. As we sprinted with luggage in tow, the doors started to close. Making eye contact with a bearded gentleman on the train, he threw his bodyweight against the door, using his body as a muscular meatbag to force the door to stay open as we ran. The doors sprung back open, we made it in, and the operator came on the intercom to scold the man for holding the door open. I gave him a fistbump.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Getting Engaged" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-4.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>2024 was also the year for some big life decisions. Much to my partner’s dismay after a morning hiking, we made a detour to a mountain vista where I awkwardly fumbled through my pocket as well as fumbled my words asking the big question. She said yes!</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Fireworks" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-5.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>In many ways, 2024 rekindled a lot of the interests I had when I was younger. Camping, fishing, film photography, to name a few. In high school, I found my mom’s old Pentax K1000 sitting in the back of a closet, and decided that I was going to start using it because they wouldn’t buy me a DSLR. In July, I took it to a camera repair shop to get it serviced, hoping to fix the light meter, the prism, and get the shutter calibrated. The repairman calls me regularly about his “project” running into issue after issue, needing to source parts from Japan, and I have not yet gotten it back. Sorry mom.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="A cat in Hawaii" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-6.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>But in the meantime, I purchased a working, fully functional Canonet QL17 GIII from Japan to try my hand at some rangefinder film photography. There’s just something about holding a hefty, physical camera that reminds you that taking photos is an act of capturing things in the real world, a rebellion against our increasingly digital world. Eventually, I’d like to start developing my own film, but for now every roll gets mailed to San Clemente for processing.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Magical Hawaii sunset" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-7.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>2024 sent me back to Hawaii, the enchanting, magical place that I have not visited since Bush was president. As a child, I remember the dipping my toes in the warm ocean and consuming incredible barbecued meats, both of which remained true this time around. In Waikiki, we discovered a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/spd8MwHDjemDKNxZ7">Japanese restaurant selling Oxtail Ramen</a>, and I still dream about the rich, dreamy broth. Gotta learn to make it at home.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Coffee cherries on the tree" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-8.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>And then, Kona Coffee. I used to think that coffee beans were a good souvenir for friends back home, but then I realized that just about everyone has their own preferences when it comes to their cup of joe. Coffee is personal, and seeing it growing in a farm and learning about the processes involved for harvesting, filtering, and roasting certainly shed some light on the number of coffee trees needed to ensure I am a functional human being.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="My old Audi" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-9.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>This old Audi. I talked about this car in <a href="/toward-unsustainability/">my last post on this blog</a>, and it still remains a car I spend a lot of time and money learning about, maintaining, and repairing. Ever since the first time I was in the market for a car as a high schooler, I couldn’t help but look at listings for cool, non-running project cars that I could get for next to nothing. I remember scrolling through pages of retired police V8 Crown Victorias for $1000, old BMW E30s, or anything else that was cool and fun.</p><div class="image-wrap cover svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="My old Audi" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-10.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>I’m still no expert on cars, but I’ve stepped up to the challenge of figuring things out when needed. When a dead crankshaft position sensor caused the car to die once the engine came up to temperature, I spent weeks debugging before realizing the sensor I had just replaced a couple months back was bad out of the box. Having a project disconnected from business deliverables, the pressure of a manager, or deadlines has made working on this car almost meditative.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="My old Audi" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-11.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>And to be honest, I really don’t think I even enjoy driving all that much. For me, being able to take things apart, learn how they work, and put them back together is fulfilling in all the right ways. It tickles the part of my brain that curious about technology and engineering, and that it’s really not too difficult when you really put in the effort to learn it. I’ve started an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/pearlquattro/">Instagram</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/@black-widow-garage">YouTube channel</a> in the process, which I hope to keep updated with little projects here and there. Or maybe they’ll never get updated again. Who knows.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Pilots getting into an airplane cockpit" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-12.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>If you know me, even before I was interested in cars I was interested in airplanes. As soon as school was out in middle school I would run over to the wood shop classroom, where the model airplane club would meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I would pull my project out of the cabinet and begin cutting and gluing wood before our mentor arrived. Mister Lou Young, a retired NACA (pre-NASA) engineer with thick glasses and a big nose that would graciously volunteer to help kids build airplanes out of balsa wood every week. From Mister Young I learned not only the craftsmanship of building an airplane out of balsa wood and tissue paper, but also how to calculate angles of attack, aileron angles, and the center of gravity.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Rocket taking off into the sky" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-13.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>Maybe one day I’ll take to the sky again, but until then I’m glad to have captured all these moments of 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[What I learned driving a vintage Audi across the country.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt="Innovating Toward Unsustainability" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/11/toward-unsustainability.jpg" width="100%"><p>There is perhaps nothing more quintessentially American than long road trips. The open road beckons the adventurous soul to traverse the vast expanse of this diverse country. Driving from one coast to the other carries one through the stories of countless miles, echoes of bygone eras, through communities of both fulfilled dreams and bitter disappointment.</p><p>It was only recently that I went on this journey for the first time in my life, after having so far lived without the experience of traveling across the country by car. It was my first trip, but not the first trip of my well-traveled companion, a little pearl white Audi coupe that was ready to teach me a few things. At thirty-three years old, she’s lived in Texas, California, Colorado, Ohio, North Carolina, and was now taking me back to Arizona.</p><p>Mark picked me up from the airport in Charlotte and drove me to his little warehouse. Nestled among other vintage vehicles of another era, I packed my suitcase into the hatch, and cranked the engine for the first time. I gave the car a quick once-over, checking tires, brakes, engine oil, and other fluids, while Mark signed the official bill of sale.</p><p>There was no going back now, we were officially on the road.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Taking delivery of my 1990 Coupe Quattro" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/11/taking-delivery.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>When our appliances break down and the cost of repair approaches the cost of an entirely new unit, we usually toss out the old one and don’t look back. Maybe it ends up in a recycling center, a landfill, a junkyard, or is sold for scrap, but to us, it doesn’t matter. In our relentless pursuit of technological advancement, we find ourselves believing that technological complexity has become synonymous with progress. We inherently expect every generation of new iPhones to have more features, better cameras, a bigger screen, etc.</p><p>But there are always a group of nutcases, enthusiasts who can’t be bothered by modern trends, who do whatever it takes to preserve, retrofit, and maintain vintage cars and devices. Sometimes, the pendulum swings back in their direction, vindicating all the years of putting their faith in an obsolete technology. I’m talking about things like the manual transmission, vinyl records, film photography, or mechanical keyboards, obsolete technologies that are now once again growing in popularity year over year as people realize that innovation is not always progress.</p><p>There are many reasons not to drive a vintage car. Automotive safety, emissions regulations, and parts availability are all quandaries that have plagued vintage car enthusiasts. But talk to anyone who has decided to persevere through these challenges to keep an old vehicle in their garage, and they’ll talk endlessly about the quality and simplicity that simply no longer exists.</p><p>The first few miles were a dance with the unknown, as every creak and groan of the vintage vehicle whispered the tales of its age. Would this relic hold up under the strain of the open road, or would it succumb to the inevitable breakdown that seems to befall even the most reliable of companions on a cross-country journey?</p><p>Reality started to sink in the first twenty minutes on the road, when I found out that the air conditioning system was non-operational. Without air conditioning, I was missing one of the most important amenities of the modern era, and would make this road trip so much more painful. But other than the lack of interior climate control, a cruise control that temperamentally stopped working, and what felt like a minor slip in the clutch pedal, Pearl was comfortable on the freeway, ready to stretch her legs and keep pace with everything else on the road.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Nothing like a retro heckblende" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/11/rear-end.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>Nostalgia is a powerful drug. It’s a common trope in essays like this or interviews with car collectors to hear about the posters they had up in their childhood bedrooms, or the cars they raced in video games as they were coming of age. Or maybe it’s triggered by the smell of a carbureted engine or sound of an engine built when mufflers and catalytic converters did not come standard.</p><p>So why did I buy a car that rolled off the assembly line before my parents even met? I could tell you about the technical configuration that exists in very few other cars: the five cylinder naturally aspirated engine, the two-door coupe chassis, the five speed manual, and the quattro all-wheel drive system. But even more importantly, I’m eager to become a part of the community connected through forums and facebook groups that are trading and refurbishing old parts. I’m drawn by the challenge of rethinking sustainability by maintaining an older vehicle.</p><p>A generation of consumers are waking up to sustainability. Our slogans tell us to protect the environment, to reduce, reuse, recycle. Laws introduce incentives to buy electric vehicles, create a market to regulate industrial emissions, and facilitate recycling programs to convince us to discard more consciously. Corporations, the very ones writing the doctrine of planned obsolescence, are touting their commitments to sustainable energy, waste reduction, and many other green initiatives. Many of my own friends and family have bought electric vehicles, choosing to opt in to new attempts of protecting our environment.</p><p>But the push for electric vehicles in the name of sustainability has always felt backwards to me. Instead of reducing the number of cars on the road by investing in public transit, converting gasoline-powered vehicles to hybrid or electric, or finding other ways to drastically reduce emissions, the solution given to us is to completely rebuild the entire vehicle fleet and infrastructure across the US with electric cars that are on average far bigger and heavier than the cars currently on the road.</p><div class="image-wrap cover svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Home in the desert" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/11/through-the-desert.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>Breakdowns did occur, as if to validate the concerns that had nagged at the corners of my mind. At my cousin’s home in Dallas, I discovered a fuse that was so burnt it was melted, a fan relay that was straight up missing in action, and an alternator belt that decided it no longer wanted to be a part of the system. We found ourselves fortuitously broken down in the parking lot of an Audi dealership, where a service manager told me he had never seen this car in over ten years of working for Audi. Their generosity had us back on the road the next day.</p><p>One of the supposed selling points of electric vehicles is that they are lower maintenance merely due to the fact that they have far fewer moving parts. Gone are regular oil changes, spark plugs, coolant leaks, and all the other regular maintenance that comes with a gasoline-burning engine. And yet, not a single manufacturer has made their electric vehicles easily serviceable by the consumer the way that most gasoline cars have been in the past. Functionality is locked down in software and other proprietary hardware, essentially forcing consumers to pay the price quoted by the manufacturer for any kind of repairs or maintenance.</p><p>It’s hard to say what things will look like thirty years from now. Will our policies and technologies of today build a future where we have successfully figured out how to run sustainable societies? Will any automaker of the future prioritize user-friendly repairs and maintenance? Will self-driving cars make us even more car-dependent?</p><p>Luckily, the rest of the road trip was smooth sailing. She handled the open roads in West Texas with beauty and grace, cruising swiftly through the final thousand miles. A sense of relief was palpable as we arrived home, knowing that any further mechanical issues could be dealt with on a far more flexible schedule. The next few weeks had me doing an oil change, replacing a CV axle boot, and other small odds and ends.</p><p>As I reflect on this journey over half a year later, I can’t help but feel gratitude. Gratitude toward the people that have so meticulously maintained the vehicle now in my stable, but also grateful for the opportunity to explore my home country by car and see landscapes I have never seen before.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt="ScrollyVideo.js" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/01/scrollyvideo.jpg" width="100%"><p>You’ve probably seen it in a fancy visual journalism piece from a well-known media organization: the scrolling video. On first thought, it seems simple enough: use Javascript to figure out how far down the page the user has scrolled, and programmatically move the playhead of the video to the appropriate point so that the video reacts to the user’s scroll event.</p><div class="video-wrap full svelte-1f7061r"><video alt="video" src="/media/2023/01/scrollyvideo-1.mp4" autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata" class="svelte-1f7061r"></video> </div><p>But it’s not that easy (discussed below), and I’m finally <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://scrollyvideo.js.org/">releasing an open source library</a> with components in React, Svelte, Vue, and vanilla javascript to make scrolling video projects easier. Early versions implementations can be seen in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.cw.com.tw/tra-train-crash/">projects I did for Commonwealth Magazine</a>, or even in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/bluestone-jim-justice-north-birmingham">this ProPublica report</a>. This was a project sitting under wraps for nearly year, as it got lost under much of my other day-to-day responsibilities. I finally found the time to clean up the documentation, test different frameworks, and get this project out the door.</p><h2 id="currenttime">CurrentTime</h2><p>Unfortunately, video formats were never designed with this use case in mind, and will often take seconds or longer to load the frame under normal circumstances. Used in a scrolling video, this results in a horribly choppy experience. The reason this happens is videos are typically encoded using keyframes set every 30 frames or so. In videos, keyframes are frames that contain the pixel data for the entire frame, whereas frames that are not keyframes only hold the “difference” between this frame and the last frame. Having frames only encode frames that have changed allows the video to be compressed to a smaller size, as most videos are only expected to be played forwards.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Keyframes allow video frames to only store the difference from frame to frame." src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/01/keyframes.png" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> <div class="caption svelte-1p9e9k9">Visualizing a video frame simply storing the difference between frames.</div></div><p>Therefore, when it comes to exporting video for a “scrolly” use case, the recommendation is to export it with the setting keyframes=1, which tells the encoder that every single frame is a keyframe. While this solves our problem of allowing the video to dynamically load the right frame of the video much faster, it also causes the size of the video file to increase significantly, all other settings being equal. In my experience, going down this path will result in re-exporting the video multiple times while adjusting the quality setting to find a compromise between file size and video quality, which is not ideal.</p><h2 id="playbackrate">PlaybackRate</h2><p>After experimenting with this method for a while, I found a second approach: simply playing and pausing the video while dynamically adjusting the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/playbackRate">playback rate</a>. If you’ve ever played around with video player settings, you’ll know that videos on the web often have the option of changing the playback speed of the video, allowing you to power through a lecture at two or three times speed. In fact, most web browsers support up to eight times speed, a speed that I have no honest idea when one would actually want to use in real life. Using playback rate, I can essentially mimic the effect of a user scrolling fast or slow, while relying on the video player to decode the frames in order, making the forward scrolling experience extremely smooth.</p><p>However, the catch with this method is that playback rate cannot be a negative number, so scrolling backwards must still be done with the first method above. Theoretically you could export an identical video in reverse and have two video elements that show or hide depending on the scroll direction, but scrollyVideo.js currently does not support this option. Additionally, Safari for some reason is less performant using this approach than the one above, so this library detects Safari and forces it to use the first method.</p><h2 id="webcodecs">WebCodecs</h2><p>The final approach I stumbled across was using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API">WebCodecs API</a> to convert a video into individual frames in the browser. Unfortunately, WebCodecs is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://caniuse.com/webcodecs">only supported in Chrome</a> at the moment, with no estimated release in any of the other browsers. And while I did <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ennuicastr/libavjs-webcodecs-polyfill">find a polyfill for WebCodecs</a>, I was unable to get it working with ScrollyVideo, so this method is limited to Chromium-based browsers only.</p><p>Essentially, by reading all the frames from a video ahead of time, this method is able to have any possible frame immediately ready for painting to a canvas. The downside? It takes a bit of time before the video is fully processed, so any immediate usage of this method will likely fall back to one of the earlier ones. Going this route also requires more memory and processing power, something that lower-end android devices may not handle well.</p><h2 id="additional-use-cases">Additional Use Cases</h2><p>For more creative use cases, scrolling may not be the only way that a project may want to control the playback and position of a video. Perhaps you want to control the position of the video based on mouse movement or something else. By exposing <code>setCurrentTimePercent</code> from the library, you can also directly set the position the video.</p><div class="video-wrap full svelte-1f7061r"><video alt="video" src="/media/2023/01/scrollyvideo-2.mp4" autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata" class="svelte-1f7061r"></video> </div><h2 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h2><p>That said, the implementation of this project was built with a vanilla javascript installation in mind, with all the logic living inside <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/dkaoster/scrolly-video/blob/main/src/ScrollyVideo.js">ScrollyVideo.js</a>. The React, Svelte, and Vue components are simply wrappers around the plain javascript implementation, which turns out to be much easier than trying to create a WebComponent.</p><p>That said, I’m looking forward to seeing this in the wild, and if you have any further questions, find any bugs, or want to contribute, feel free to reach out and I’m happy to talk!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt="Thoughts on Journalistic Cartography" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/01/journalistic-cartography.jpg" width="100%"><p>One of the reasons I look forward to the end of the year is seeing all the year in reviews that different news organizations publish. Whether it be a collection of photos from the year, most popular articles, or the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/28/us/2022-year-in-graphics.html">year in graphics</a>, these summaries provide a reminder of the news events and journalistic storytelling that were published, and the creative approaches that were built upon or invented in the past year.</p><p>News events of last year have resulted in a large variety of journalistic maps, which have become an indispensable part of reporting and helping readers understand the situation on the ground. These maps have helped readers understand the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/world/europe/ukraine-maps.html">war in Ukraine</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.cw.com.tw/taiwan-strait-2021-en/index.html">tensions in the Taiwan Strait</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/13/climate/climate-footprint-map-neighborhood.html">effects of climate change</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/16/us/elections/republicans-house-congress.html">political divides across the US</a>, and so much more.</p><p>The tools for creating these maps and the conventions for creating interactive and understandable maps have also made huge strides in the past couple years, enabling graphics teams to publish quickly and consistently. For those who work on news graphics day to day, this is not new information for us, but rather advancements that we simply take for granted or even forget their significance once we adapt them into our workflows. But for those who are trying to better understand the technical implementations, whether you a student, editor, or other play another role, this post is a discussion about the current state of things, some suggestions, and the challenges ahead.</p><p>Data and graphics journalism has, from its very inception, trodden the line between helping readers understand stories beyond what plain words can do without becoming too technical that only experts can understand. However, as trends change, what readers might understand or not understand changes, allowing for data and graphics teams to also push the envelope on what is a good, understandable piece of data or visual journalism.</p><h2 id="the-evolution-of-journalistic-cartography">The Evolution of Journalistic Cartography</h2><p>Ten years ago, The New York Times published <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/index.html">Snow Fall</a>, one of the earliest examples of visual storytelling on the web that would go on to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/insider/snow-fall-at-10-how-it-changed-journalism.html">win a Pulitzer Prize</a> and be widely regarded as the piece that started it all. As a college freshman at the time, I missed the publication of the piece and the resulting discourse around the report at the time, but looking back now it’s clear how far projects have come.</p><div class="video-wrap full svelte-1f7061r"><video alt="video" src="/media/2023/01/snowfall.mp4" autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata" class="svelte-1f7061r"></video> </div><p>Looking back at Snow Fall now, it’s striking how much of the visual assets were simply embedded into autoplaying, looping, silent videos. Today, while video is still a common format to build visual journalism pieces off of, there has been a trend toward browser rendering or vector formats and animations for better clarity, performance, and interactivity. The 3D topographical model of the mountain as seen in Snow Fall was only possible through rendering a video back in 2012, but today it would be trivial to do something similar in mapboxgl.js for far better performance and resolution, such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/04/climate/south-asia-monsoon-climate-change.html">this piece on the Monsoons in South Asia</a>.</p><p>Design-wise, we’ve also seen maps in news stories evolve to be clearer, better labeled to fit the stories, and colors and colors more carefully picked. Extraneous details are made grayscale or monochromatic, while critical pieces of information are given colors that are bright and clear. Animations and transitions are used sparingly but effectively to draw attention to important changes or layers of a story. Words are rendered by the browser whenever possible to make text accessible and clear. Legends are obvious and intuitive to help the reader understand any special lines or arrows on the map.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Ukraine Map by The New York Times" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/01/nytimes-ukraine-map.png" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>Maps have also adapted to social media platforms, being exported in small, bite-sized pieces that are published to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, where there is even less room for superfluous information. It’s often difficult enough to make sure a map is legible on both desktop and mobile, let alone also optimized for each social media platform. This is where graphics teams have developed all sorts of internal tools to handle the rapid iteration of news graphics, especially when a story may need to be updated live and shared across social media.</p><h2 id="svg-and-vectors">SVG and Vectors</h2><p>One of the most important tools for making dynamic, flexible graphics and maps is to keep things in a vector format as much as possible. Most of the time, this means using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVGs (scalable vector graphics)</a> to display on webpages and mobile applications. SVGs, when rendered through an application, allow for rapid edits and updates. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, the most widely used tool for data graphics on the web, primarily works by manipulating SVG objects, including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/d3/d3-geo">powerful functions for handling projections and drawing geospatial data</a>.</p><p>SVGs are attractive due to their platform-independent compatibility, such as being able to import an SVG map directly into print tools such as Adobe Illustrator, Indesign, etc. With computers and mobile devices getting more and more powerful, having maps rendered on the client is performant and has the sharpest visual appearance.</p><p>However, the challenge for SVG maps on the web is that geospatial data is most transferred as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://geojson.org/">geojson</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/topojson/topojson">topojson</a>, which is not a particularly space-efficient format. Generating and transferring geojson files to handle a dynamic, interactive map is expensive, often resulting in files that are hundreds of megabytes, which is unacceptable for users on mobile connections.</p><p>One alternative to the geojson format that has gained popularity in recent years is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://flatgeobuf.org/">flatgeobuf</a>, a way to host a single file with complex geometries but have the client only download the geographic area it needs via http range requests, which can save a significant amount of bandwidth for large-scale interactive map experiences without the complexity of the other option: generating and hosting tiles, discussed below.</p><h2 id="map-tiles">Map Tiles</h2><p>Map tiles work by splitting up the world into square tiles based on the zoom level and coordinates, so the client downloads and renders only the tiles it needs for the map view. If you’ve used online mapping tools such as google maps and have noticed that the map tends to load in squares, those are map tiles being rendered under the hood.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Tiles" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/media/2023/01/tiles.gif" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>One of the early, popular libraries for implementing tiled maps is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://leafletjs.com/">leaflet</a>. Leaflet has a simple, well-documented, and extremely flexible set of tools for embedding a customizable, interactive map into a web page. Leaflet maps are still common today in many news projects. However, the go-to software stack for most web maps is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>. Mapbox allows users to host, customize, and share their own map tiles allowing so many newsrooms with fledgling graphics teams to get up and running quickly with powerful journalistic cartography.</p><p>And just as Mapbox has enabled a whole slew of journalistic cartography, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://maplibre.org/projects/">MapLibre</a> has been developing an open source version of MapboxGL as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#200">MapboxGL version 2 has transitioned to a not quite open source model</a>. The potential for new open source tools to even further transform the way that news organizations create maps is exciting. Tiling tools such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe">Tippecanoe</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protomaps.com/docs/pmtiles/">PMTiles</a>, and others will continue to evolve and become part of our cartography toolkits.</p><h2 id="webgl">WebGL</h2><p>Under the hood of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/">mapboxgl.js</a> is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">webGL</a>, a browser API that gives access to shaders that are run directly on the GPU for maximum performance in rendering to web browsers. WebGL has been used for games on the web, complex 3D modeling, and more recently cartography applications. While having all of this power to utilize the GPU allows for so much more dynamic and powerful graphics, shader code is written in a completely different paradigm than something like Javascript or Python, making it often difficult to create graphics in WebGL.</p><div class="video-wrap full svelte-1f7061r"><video alt="video" src="/media/2023/01/webgl.mov" autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata" class="svelte-1f7061r"></video> </div><p>So far, the most common implementation of WebGL has been these kinds of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/04/climate/south-asia-monsoon-climate-change.html">wind or weather flows</a>. But as graphics and journalistic cartography becomes an even more integral part of the newsroom workflow, I expect to see more graphics using WebGL, utilizing movement and animations for even more map detail in all sorts of areas.</p><h2 id="looking-to-2023">Looking to 2023</h2><p>As we start a new year, I’m excited to see the kinds of projects and digital cartography techniques that are published in this coming year, especially as humanity encounters climate, political, social, economic, and cultural challenges. I’m excited to continue building visualizations to accompany news stories, whether it be cartographic or otherwise.</p><p><em>Shameless plug: I am open to freelance or contract roles for this year, so if you’d like to work with me on a project, don’t hesitate to reach out!</em></p>]]></content:encoded>
