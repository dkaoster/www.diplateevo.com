            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt="How the Washington Post Covered the 2024 Elections" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2025/11/wapo-election.jpg" width="100%"><p>Building a live elections results tracker is like building a race car for a race. You don’t get to pick when the race is, you have no way to postpone the race if challenges arise, you have to follow the rules of the race committee, and you spend years building a system or machine that only runs for a couple of hours or days. And if something goes wrong, every second you spend fixing a problem is a second you lose off the clock. But if successful, you bring in money for your sponsors, recognition for your brand, and even influence consumer spending decisions. It’s a completely different workflow compared to building a typical production software application that adheres to a regular cadence of testing and release cycles. Everything needs to be built with performance, rapid recovery, simplicity, and flexibility in mind, and thoroughly tested against all sorts of edge cases and hypothetical scenarios.</p><p>At the Washington Post, that is the level of energy, focus, and determination we put into building the system we used to cover <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/results/2024/11/05/president/">the 2024 election cycle</a>, which had no shortage of twists and turns. In 2023, we set out with a plan to make our 2024 elections coverage the most ambitious, most product oriented, and most technologically challenging live elections results coverage any news organization has ever undertaken.</p><h2 id="a-page-for-every-race">A page for every race</h2><p>On November 5th alone, we published over 650 election results pages for the general election and live election results components <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/10/22/what-expect-washington-posts-election-coverage/">all over the web and mobile apps</a>. This is an order of magnitude more than any live elections coverage the Post has done in the past in order to rank on search engines no matter what election a user searched for. This meant that we needed to rebuild much of our technology stack in order to support such a large number of pages with live updating elections results. On top of that, we also published live election components such as maps, tables, and graphs to our homepage as well as the live activity feeds. Our bets paid off, as we reached over 9.5 million unique pageviews over the course of the night and into the next day. The election results infrastructure was built and tested through the entire election season, starting from the first Iowa Caucuses and New Hampshire Primaries all the way until November 5th. Every single primary and special election gave us the opportunity to test our election results infrastructure.</p><p>Rebuilding our stack meant rethinking the data flows from the ground up. We decided to use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dagster.io/">dagster</a>, a tool that allows us to easily define data pipelines and data workflows to better manage and scale the step functions that we had previously. Paired with dagster, we wrote all candidates, ballot appearances, and results data to a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hasura.io/">hasura database</a>, which was also hooked up to a custom elections admin for managing pages, components, and other elections configuration options. The dagster jobs wrote all of these results out as a set of configs and results json files to S3, where the frontend would simply read the results to render the maps, tables, and graphs. The dagster jobs could intelligently determine which races had new updates and push the results only to the results files that needed to be updated. This system enabled us to have the most recent vote updates on our pages within thirty seconds of them being reported by the AP, and also enabled us to create the &quot;elections dashboard&quot; described later in this article.</p><p>The static JSON files written to S3 to effectively provide an isolation layer between the frontend and the backend, giving us a flexible, versatile connection between the frontend and the data pipelines. If needed, we could even run the election off of a dagster instance run on an engineer&#39;s laptop, which did end up almost happening for certain primary elections. The frontend, hosted as a Next.js app on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, simply accesses S3 for page configs and results data. We leveraged Vercel&#39;s incremental static regeneration and caching in order to squeeze as much scalability and performance as possible for readers. Additionally, with a newsroom operating at the scale of the Washington Post, many of our colleagues wanted to have our live elections assets embedded in places all over the website such as the homepage, article pages, mobile apps, and even the video background on the live show, which were all supported by some combination of embeddable frontend components or backend data feeds.</p><h2 id="tables-charts-and-robotext">Tables, Charts, and Robotext</h2><p>One of the challenges when it comes to reporting real-time elections data is that there are many idiosyncrasies with how the vote gets counted that require some careful consideration and design in order to give readers the correct understanding of how to interpret the results. For instance, voting results reported live on election night represents the votes that have been counted first. Some states might count rural votes first, while others states might count mail-in votes last. These details are often reflected in early patterns based on how a state processes the vote count logistically, meaning that final results often look very different from early results. To properly capture this phenomenon, our team came up with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/04/post-pulse-election-results-model-2024/">Post Pulse</a>, a way to capture currently counted results in the context of how we expect the vote to end up.</p><div class="image-wrap  svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="election model" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2025/11/wapo-election-model.png" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>Another very important piece of elections coverage is all the automated text around the pages that are often overlooked. Despite using many charts and graphs to visualize the data, it is still crucial to use text to clearly communicate the most important takeaways from the data. Many of us elections nerds enjoy diving straight into the tables and graphs, but in user studies we are often reminded that not all users know how to easily read tables and graphs, and often need to be told how to properly interpret the data. We call this robotext, and while robotext seems like a simple text template, a significant amount of time is spent editing and validating the logic for various scenarios that do come up.</p><h2 id="maps-maps-maps">Maps maps maps</h2><p>For 2024 elections coverage, one of the things that we rebuilt on the front end was the map infrastructure. Prior to 2024, The Washington Post elections team was using a custom geospatial file format that needed to be manually generated for every single congressional district, township, county, and state, and rendered on the frontend as SVGs. Making all the maps in this custom geospatial format for the general election would have been an enormous undertaking, so instead we decided to create even more work for ourselves by rebuilding the frontend mapping infrastructure on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.protomaps.com/pmtiles/">PMTiles</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/">MapLibreGL.js</a>.</p><p>Utilizing some of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kschaul.com/post/2023/02/16/how-the-post-is-replacing-mapbox-with-open-source-solutions/">prior art created by the graphics team</a>, we decided to take a similar approach. Using a combination of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mapshaper.org/">mapshaper</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe">tippecanoe</a> commands, we wrote a script to download, process, and output the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.protomaps.com/pmtiles/">PMTiles</a> that we need for all the geographic boundaries for states, counties, districts, townships, and wards, allowing us to use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js/docs/">MapLibreGL.js</a> on the frontend to display and render a map based entirely on just a map config string. While this system was a lot of effort to engineer, test, and deploy, it also proved to be much more performant on the frontend for browsers supporting WebGL.</p><h2 id="a-firehose-for-those-that-want-to-drink">A firehose for those that want to drink</h2><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/results/2024/11/05/election-dashboard/">elections dashboard</a>, or what we refer to internally as “the firehose” is a brand-new product our team devised for the 2024 general election. The dashboard serves as a tool for elections data nerds to be able to see the details of every single vote update as it comes in, conveniently showing the “hurdle”, or the percentage of votes the trailing candidate needs in order to catch up with the leading candidate at every update.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="elections dashboard" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2025/11/wapo-election-firehose.png" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><h2 id="components-for-the-rest-of-the-site">Components for the rest of the site</h2><p>Besides elections results pages and the firehose, live elections results were also displayed on the homepage, the live updates feed, and the mobile apps. To support this, we created a system for live election components that could be embedded anywhere, enabling our editors to be more creative and provide charts, tables, and maps across the website. Another highly visible piece of web real-estate that we took over for the general election was adding a subnav to all pages across the Washington Post. The Subnav drove traffic from around the site to our elections results pages. And for iOS users, we implemented a live activity for iOS that allowed users to keep track of the presidential balance of power from their lock screens.</p><h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2><p>I&#39;ve glossed over a lot of details and other tasks that made the 2024 such a huge success for the Washington Post, and I&#39;ve also taken almost exactly a year to finally publish this piece, but even a year later I often think back on this project as one of the most impactful things I&#39;ve ever had the honor of taking a part in. I decided recently that I should document as much as I can as the details slowly start to fade from my memory, but I doubt I&#39;ll ever get over my hatred of the ridiculousness of the American election system, probably to wake up from nightmares of fighting Maine township data for the rest of my life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Last Friday was my last day at the Washington Post. Amidst all the challenges facing the Washington Post and the media at large, I submitted my resignation and will be starting a new job in a new industry.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt="Leaving News" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2025/01/wapo-newsroom.jpg" width="100%"><p>Ever since graduating in 2016, I’ve worked for four newsrooms and media-adjacent organizations in two different countries and languages. I’ve given talks at conferences, universities, and podcasts. Working in newsrooms always presented challenges that were both difficult and fulfilling, and among other things inspired me to pursue my master’s degree in cartography and GIS.</p><p>Last Friday was my last day at the Washington Post. Amidst all the challenges facing the Washington Post and the media at large, I submitted my resignation and will be starting a new job in a new industry. Skip to the bottom if you want to know where I’ll be going, but first I need to get some catharsis out of the way.</p><p>I’ve always been drawn to newsrooms because I’ve strongly believed that newsrooms are among the most fertile environments for innovation and creative engineering. There’s nothing quite like working technology in a newsroom, largely because the constraints of the news cycle leads to developing technology that is scrappy, effective, experimental, and published at scale. It’s why tools such as D3 and Svelte were developed in news organizations.</p><p>Ever since Snowfall was published in 2012, every year there are more and more creative approaches to digital reporting, including elections results coverage, which is what I have spent the past two years working on at The Washington Post. I’ll eventually publish something more specific to the work accomplished in the 2024 election cycle, but I honestly feel that in 2024 we reached a peak elections coverage after taking everything we’ve learned since starting digital elections coverage.</p><p>But beyond the satisfaction of seeing projects go live, one of the best parts of working in news organizations is the people that you meet along the way. Working on digital storytelling innovations is rarely a career that one accidentally falls into or is advertised at the top of any “most prestigious careers” list. It’s a job that almost everyone working in actively and specifically seeks out, and also one that attracts a huge diversity of interesting, creative, and technical people who chose to pursue this career for reasons other than money.</p><p>I’ve met so many people along the way, whether as colleagues I interacted with daily, people I’ve met at conferences, or people who have simply reached out to me on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Email. Like journalists, every single technologist working with newsrooms have had wildly diverse opinions, approaches, and perspectives leading to insanely creative works and results.</p><p>So why am I leaving what I once considered to be a dream job in media? The primary reason is that news organizations are no longer what they were a decade ago. The support for and investment in creative, digital, and data driven storytelling is no longer as strong as it once was, with many news executives pivoting to a dubious pursuit of “AI”, ignoring the legacy and foundational cornerstones of journalism that have built the news organizations of the past.</p><p>Additionally, the culture of empowering employees to openly experiment and innovate has changed into a top-down approach where executives no longer seem to trust employees to build things that matter. Gone are the days of hackathons, open source, 20% time, and intern programs that made a positive difference on people like myself when I was starting out in my career.</p><p>To put it bluntly, the trend of declining local newsrooms across America has really begun to impact even the strongest news organizations that have survived up to this point, and the decisions being made at the top of these organizations are only contributing to their demise.</p><p>I’ve wrestled with my personal responsibility in this for a long time now. Given my experience and background, I would be well positioned to fight to keep the environments that helped me grow as a news developer and build toward when things are once again better. But if I’m honest with myself, I’ve become a little burnt out on news, jaded by all the disappointments over the past few years, and really craving a chance to do something completely different.</p><p>For that, I will be starting at Rivian in a couple of weeks. Although I never pictured myself working in automotive, conversations I had throughout the interview process have certainly piqued my interest, and I’m excited to bring my experience into a new industry. It feels bittersweet leaving the news industry, especially at a time like this, but I’m also looking forward to having the opportunity to try something new.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt="2024 Photoessay: Rekindling the Inner Child" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-1.jpg" width="100%"><p>2024 was a special year, and not just because I entered my fourth decade of life, but also my third year living in the desert. For the past three years, Tucson has served as somewhat of an oasis for me. A place where few distractions come out to bother me, allowing me to focus fully on my work, relationships that matter, and space to explore interests both new and old. But I’ve also done a significant amount of travel in 2024: trips to California, Hawaii, Washington DC, and New York punctuated the year, giving me moments of execution and celebration when needed.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Chinese New Year Spread" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-2.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>Food was also a theme of this year, as it is every year. Being away from large urban cultural centers like the bay area, Los Angeles, or Taipei, most meals dining out ended in something to the effect of “you’re asking me to pay this much for food I can make better myself?” Luckily I found myself in the company of friends willing to experiment in the kitchen, making all sorts of gourmet delectables out of the sheer fact that we had no alternatives readily accessible. Chinese new year, random gatherings to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKUrnDWeRIc">make the quintessential xiaolongbao</a>, and any excuse to eat had us pulling the flour out of the cupboard or browsing facebook marketplace for kitchen aids.</p><div class="image-wrap cover svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Nightfall over NYC" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-3.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>In March, I stepped off the Amtrak in Penn Station to find myself back navigating the underworld of New York City, a place I called home for three years fresh out of college but hadn’t been back to in over five years. Rushing to buy a new MetroCard and pulling the ideal swipe speed out of deep recesses of my muscle memory, I noticed our train on the platform getting ready to depart. As we sprinted with luggage in tow, the doors started to close. Making eye contact with a bearded gentleman on the train, he threw his bodyweight against the door, using his body as a muscular meatbag to force the door to stay open as we ran. The doors sprung back open, we made it in, and the operator came on the intercom to scold the man for holding the door open. I gave him a fistbump.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Getting Engaged" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-4.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>2024 was also the year for some big life decisions. Much to my partner’s dismay after a morning hiking, we made a detour to a mountain vista where I awkwardly fumbled through my pocket as well as fumbled my words asking the big question. She said yes!</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Fireworks" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-5.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>In many ways, 2024 rekindled a lot of the interests I had when I was younger. Camping, fishing, film photography, to name a few. In high school, I found my mom’s old Pentax K1000 sitting in the back of a closet, and decided that I was going to start using it because they wouldn’t buy me a DSLR. In July, I took it to a camera repair shop to get it serviced, hoping to fix the light meter, the prism, and get the shutter calibrated. The repairman calls me regularly about his “project” running into issue after issue, needing to source parts from Japan, and I have not yet gotten it back. Sorry mom.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="A cat in Hawaii" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-6.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>But in the meantime, I purchased a working, fully functional Canonet QL17 GIII from Japan to try my hand at some rangefinder film photography. There’s just something about holding a hefty, physical camera that reminds you that taking photos is an act of capturing things in the real world, a rebellion against our increasingly digital world. Eventually, I’d like to start developing my own film, but for now every roll gets mailed to San Clemente for processing.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Magical Hawaii sunset" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-7.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>2024 sent me back to Hawaii, the enchanting, magical place that I have not visited since Bush was president. As a child, I remember the dipping my toes in the warm ocean and consuming incredible barbecued meats, both of which remained true this time around. In Waikiki, we discovered a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/spd8MwHDjemDKNxZ7">Japanese restaurant selling Oxtail Ramen</a>, and I still dream about the rich, dreamy broth. Gotta learn to make it at home.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Coffee cherries on the tree" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-8.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>And then, Kona Coffee. I used to think that coffee beans were a good souvenir for friends back home, but then I realized that just about everyone has their own preferences when it comes to their cup of joe. Coffee is personal, and seeing it growing in a farm and learning about the processes involved for harvesting, filtering, and roasting certainly shed some light on the number of coffee trees needed to ensure I am a functional human being.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="My old Audi" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-9.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>This old Audi. I talked about this car in <a href="/toward-unsustainability/">my last post on this blog</a>, and it still remains a car I spend a lot of time and money learning about, maintaining, and repairing. Ever since the first time I was in the market for a car as a high schooler, I couldn’t help but look at listings for cool, non-running project cars that I could get for next to nothing. I remember scrolling through pages of retired police V8 Crown Victorias for $1000, old BMW E30s, or anything else that was cool and fun.</p><div class="image-wrap cover svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="My old Audi" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-10.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>I’m still no expert on cars, but I’ve stepped up to the challenge of figuring things out when needed. When a dead crankshaft position sensor caused the car to die once the engine came up to temperature, I spent weeks debugging before realizing the sensor I had just replaced a couple months back was bad out of the box. Having a project disconnected from business deliverables, the pressure of a manager, or deadlines has made working on this car almost meditative.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="My old Audi" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-11.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>And to be honest, I really don’t think I even enjoy driving all that much. For me, being able to take things apart, learn how they work, and put them back together is fulfilling in all the right ways. It tickles the part of my brain that curious about technology and engineering, and that it’s really not too difficult when you really put in the effort to learn it. I’ve started an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/pearlquattro/">Instagram</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/@black-widow-garage">YouTube channel</a> in the process, which I hope to keep updated with little projects here and there. Or maybe they’ll never get updated again. Who knows.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Pilots getting into an airplane cockpit" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-12.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>If you know me, even before I was interested in cars I was interested in airplanes. As soon as school was out in middle school I would run over to the wood shop classroom, where the model airplane club would meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I would pull my project out of the cabinet and begin cutting and gluing wood before our mentor arrived. Mister Lou Young, a retired NACA (pre-NASA) engineer with thick glasses and a big nose that would graciously volunteer to help kids build airplanes out of balsa wood every week. From Mister Young I learned not only the craftsmanship of building an airplane out of balsa wood and tissue paper, but also how to calculate angles of attack, aileron angles, and the center of gravity.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Rocket taking off into the sky" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2024/12/photoessay-13.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>Maybe one day I’ll take to the sky again, but until then I’m glad to have captured all these moments of 2024.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt="Innovating Toward Unsustainability" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/11/toward-unsustainability.jpg" width="100%"><p>There is perhaps nothing more quintessentially American than long road trips. The open road beckons the adventurous soul to traverse the vast expanse of this diverse country. Driving from one coast to the other carries one through the stories of countless miles, echoes of bygone eras, through communities of both fulfilled dreams and bitter disappointment.</p><p>It was only recently that I went on this journey for the first time in my life, after having so far lived without the experience of traveling across the country by car. It was my first trip, but not the first trip of my well-traveled companion, a little pearl white Audi coupe that was ready to teach me a few things. At thirty-three years old, she’s lived in Texas, California, Colorado, Ohio, North Carolina, and was now taking me back to Arizona.</p><p>Mark picked me up from the airport in Charlotte and drove me to his little warehouse. Nestled among other vintage vehicles of another era, I packed my suitcase into the hatch, and cranked the engine for the first time. I gave the car a quick once-over, checking tires, brakes, engine oil, and other fluids, while Mark signed the official bill of sale.</p><p>There was no going back now, we were officially on the road.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Taking delivery of my 1990 Coupe Quattro" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/11/taking-delivery.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>When our appliances break down and the cost of repair approaches the cost of an entirely new unit, we usually toss out the old one and don’t look back. Maybe it ends up in a recycling center, a landfill, a junkyard, or is sold for scrap, but to us, it doesn’t matter. In our relentless pursuit of technological advancement, we find ourselves believing that technological complexity has become synonymous with progress. We inherently expect every generation of new iPhones to have more features, better cameras, a bigger screen, etc.</p><p>But there are always a group of nutcases, enthusiasts who can’t be bothered by modern trends, who do whatever it takes to preserve, retrofit, and maintain vintage cars and devices. Sometimes, the pendulum swings back in their direction, vindicating all the years of putting their faith in an obsolete technology. I’m talking about things like the manual transmission, vinyl records, film photography, or mechanical keyboards, obsolete technologies that are now once again growing in popularity year over year as people realize that innovation is not always progress.</p><p>There are many reasons not to drive a vintage car. Automotive safety, emissions regulations, and parts availability are all quandaries that have plagued vintage car enthusiasts. But talk to anyone who has decided to persevere through these challenges to keep an old vehicle in their garage, and they’ll talk endlessly about the quality and simplicity that simply no longer exists.</p><p>The first few miles were a dance with the unknown, as every creak and groan of the vintage vehicle whispered the tales of its age. Would this relic hold up under the strain of the open road, or would it succumb to the inevitable breakdown that seems to befall even the most reliable of companions on a cross-country journey?</p><p>Reality started to sink in the first twenty minutes on the road, when I found out that the air conditioning system was non-operational. Without air conditioning, I was missing one of the most important amenities of the modern era, and would make this road trip so much more painful. But other than the lack of interior climate control, a cruise control that temperamentally stopped working, and what felt like a minor slip in the clutch pedal, Pearl was comfortable on the freeway, ready to stretch her legs and keep pace with everything else on the road.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Nothing like a retro heckblende" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/11/rear-end.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>Nostalgia is a powerful drug. It’s a common trope in essays like this or interviews with car collectors to hear about the posters they had up in their childhood bedrooms, or the cars they raced in video games as they were coming of age. Or maybe it’s triggered by the smell of a carbureted engine or sound of an engine built when mufflers and catalytic converters did not come standard.</p><p>So why did I buy a car that rolled off the assembly line before my parents even met? I could tell you about the technical configuration that exists in very few other cars: the five cylinder naturally aspirated engine, the two-door coupe chassis, the five speed manual, and the quattro all-wheel drive system. But even more importantly, I’m eager to become a part of the community connected through forums and facebook groups that are trading and refurbishing old parts. I’m drawn by the challenge of rethinking sustainability by maintaining an older vehicle.</p><p>A generation of consumers are waking up to sustainability. Our slogans tell us to protect the environment, to reduce, reuse, recycle. Laws introduce incentives to buy electric vehicles, create a market to regulate industrial emissions, and facilitate recycling programs to convince us to discard more consciously. Corporations, the very ones writing the doctrine of planned obsolescence, are touting their commitments to sustainable energy, waste reduction, and many other green initiatives. Many of my own friends and family have bought electric vehicles, choosing to opt in to new attempts of protecting our environment.</p><p>But the push for electric vehicles in the name of sustainability has always felt backwards to me. Instead of reducing the number of cars on the road by investing in public transit, converting gasoline-powered vehicles to hybrid or electric, or finding other ways to drastically reduce emissions, the solution given to us is to completely rebuild the entire vehicle fleet and infrastructure across the US with electric cars that are on average far bigger and heavier than the cars currently on the road.</p><div class="image-wrap cover svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Home in the desert" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/11/through-the-desert.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> </div><p>Breakdowns did occur, as if to validate the concerns that had nagged at the corners of my mind. At my cousin’s home in Dallas, I discovered a fuse that was so burnt it was melted, a fan relay that was straight up missing in action, and an alternator belt that decided it no longer wanted to be a part of the system. We found ourselves fortuitously broken down in the parking lot of an Audi dealership, where a service manager told me he had never seen this car in over ten years of working for Audi. Their generosity had us back on the road the next day.</p><p>One of the supposed selling points of electric vehicles is that they are lower maintenance merely due to the fact that they have far fewer moving parts. Gone are regular oil changes, spark plugs, coolant leaks, and all the other regular maintenance that comes with a gasoline-burning engine. And yet, not a single manufacturer has made their electric vehicles easily serviceable by the consumer the way that most gasoline cars have been in the past. Functionality is locked down in software and other proprietary hardware, essentially forcing consumers to pay the price quoted by the manufacturer for any kind of repairs or maintenance.</p><p>It’s hard to say what things will look like thirty years from now. Will our policies and technologies of today build a future where we have successfully figured out how to run sustainable societies? Will any automaker of the future prioritize user-friendly repairs and maintenance? Will self-driving cars make us even more car-dependent?</p><p>Luckily, the rest of the road trip was smooth sailing. She handled the open roads in West Texas with beauty and grace, cruising swiftly through the final thousand miles. A sense of relief was palpable as we arrived home, knowing that any further mechanical issues could be dealt with on a far more flexible schedule. The next few weeks had me doing an oil change, replacing a CV axle boot, and other small odds and ends.</p><p>As I reflect on this journey over half a year later, I can’t help but feel gratitude. Gratitude toward the people that have so meticulously maintained the vehicle now in my stable, but also grateful for the opportunity to explore my home country by car and see landscapes I have never seen before.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img alt="ScrollyVideo.js" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/01/scrollyvideo.jpg" width="100%"><p>You’ve probably seen it in a fancy visual journalism piece from a well-known media organization: the scrolling video. On first thought, it seems simple enough: use Javascript to figure out how far down the page the user has scrolled, and programmatically move the playhead of the video to the appropriate point so that the video reacts to the user’s scroll event.</p><div class="video-wrap full svelte-1f7061r"><video alt="video" src="/media/2023/01/scrollyvideo-1.mp4" autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata" class="svelte-1f7061r"></video> </div><p>But it’s not that easy (discussed below), and I’m finally <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://scrollyvideo.js.org/">releasing an open source library</a> with components in React, Svelte, Vue, and vanilla javascript to make scrolling video projects easier. Early versions implementations can be seen in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.cw.com.tw/tra-train-crash/">projects I did for Commonwealth Magazine</a>, or even in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/bluestone-jim-justice-north-birmingham">this ProPublica report</a>. This was a project sitting under wraps for nearly year, as it got lost under much of my other day-to-day responsibilities. I finally found the time to clean up the documentation, test different frameworks, and get this project out the door.</p><h2 id="currenttime">CurrentTime</h2><p>Unfortunately, video formats were never designed with this use case in mind, and will often take seconds or longer to load the frame under normal circumstances. Used in a scrolling video, this results in a horribly choppy experience. The reason this happens is videos are typically encoded using keyframes set every 30 frames or so. In videos, keyframes are frames that contain the pixel data for the entire frame, whereas frames that are not keyframes only hold the “difference” between this frame and the last frame. Having frames only encode frames that have changed allows the video to be compressed to a smaller size, as most videos are only expected to be played forwards.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-1p9e9k9"><img loading="lazy" alt="Keyframes allow video frames to only store the difference from frame to frame." src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/01/keyframes.png" width="100%" class="svelte-1p9e9k9"> <div class="caption svelte-1p9e9k9">Visualizing a video frame simply storing the difference between frames.</div></div><p>Therefore, when it comes to exporting video for a “scrolly” use case, the recommendation is to export it with the setting keyframes=1, which tells the encoder that every single frame is a keyframe. While this solves our problem of allowing the video to dynamically load the right frame of the video much faster, it also causes the size of the video file to increase significantly, all other settings being equal. In my experience, going down this path will result in re-exporting the video multiple times while adjusting the quality setting to find a compromise between file size and video quality, which is not ideal.</p><h2 id="playbackrate">PlaybackRate</h2><p>After experimenting with this method for a while, I found a second approach: simply playing and pausing the video while dynamically adjusting the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/playbackRate">playback rate</a>. If you’ve ever played around with video player settings, you’ll know that videos on the web often have the option of changing the playback speed of the video, allowing you to power through a lecture at two or three times speed. In fact, most web browsers support up to eight times speed, a speed that I have no honest idea when one would actually want to use in real life. Using playback rate, I can essentially mimic the effect of a user scrolling fast or slow, while relying on the video player to decode the frames in order, making the forward scrolling experience extremely smooth.</p><p>However, the catch with this method is that playback rate cannot be a negative number, so scrolling backwards must still be done with the first method above. Theoretically you could export an identical video in reverse and have two video elements that show or hide depending on the scroll direction, but scrollyVideo.js currently does not support this option. Additionally, Safari for some reason is less performant using this approach than the one above, so this library detects Safari and forces it to use the first method.</p><h2 id="webcodecs">WebCodecs</h2><p>The final approach I stumbled across was using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API">WebCodecs API</a> to convert a video into individual frames in the browser. Unfortunately, WebCodecs is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://caniuse.com/webcodecs">only supported in Chrome</a> at the moment, with no estimated release in any of the other browsers. And while I did <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ennuicastr/libavjs-webcodecs-polyfill">find a polyfill for WebCodecs</a>, I was unable to get it working with ScrollyVideo, so this method is limited to Chromium-based browsers only.</p><p>Essentially, by reading all the frames from a video ahead of time, this method is able to have any possible frame immediately ready for painting to a canvas. The downside? It takes a bit of time before the video is fully processed, so any immediate usage of this method will likely fall back to one of the earlier ones. Going this route also requires more memory and processing power, something that lower-end android devices may not handle well.</p><h2 id="additional-use-cases">Additional Use Cases</h2><p>For more creative use cases, scrolling may not be the only way that a project may want to control the playback and position of a video. Perhaps you want to control the position of the video based on mouse movement or something else. By exposing <code>setCurrentTimePercent</code> from the library, you can also directly set the position the video.</p><div class="video-wrap full svelte-1f7061r"><video alt="video" src="/media/2023/01/scrollyvideo-2.mp4" autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata" class="svelte-1f7061r"></video> </div><h2 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h2><p>That said, the implementation of this project was built with a vanilla javascript installation in mind, with all the logic living inside <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/dkaoster/scrolly-video/blob/main/src/ScrollyVideo.js">ScrollyVideo.js</a>. The React, Svelte, and Vue components are simply wrappers around the plain javascript implementation, which turns out to be much easier than trying to create a WebComponent.</p><p>That said, I’m looking forward to seeing this in the wild, and if you have any further questions, find any bugs, or want to contribute, feel free to reach out and I’m happy to talk!</p>]]></content:encoded>
