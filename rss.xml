            <description><![CDATA[News events of last year have resulted in a large variety of journalistic maps, which have become an indispensable part of reporting and helping readers understand the situation on the ground.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the reasons I look forward to the end of the year is seeing all the year in reviews that different news organizations publish. Whether it be a collection of photos from the year, most popular articles, or the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/28/us/2022-year-in-graphics.html">year in graphics</a>, these summaries provide a reminder of the news events and journalistic storytelling that were published, and the creative approaches that were built upon or invented in the past year.</p><p>News events of last year have resulted in a large variety of journalistic maps, which have become an indispensable part of reporting and helping readers understand the situation on the ground. These maps have helped readers understand the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/world/europe/ukraine-maps.html">war in Ukraine</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.cw.com.tw/taiwan-strait-2021-en/index.html">tensions in the Taiwan Strait</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/13/climate/climate-footprint-map-neighborhood.html">effects of climate change</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/16/us/elections/republicans-house-congress.html">political divides across the US</a>, and so much more.</p><p>The tools for creating these maps and the conventions for creating interactive and understandable maps have also made huge strides in the past couple years, enabling graphics teams to publish quickly and consistently. For those who work on news graphics day to day, this is not new information for us, but rather advancements that we simply take for granted or even forget their significance once we adapt them into our workflows. But for those who are trying to better understand the technical implementations, whether you a student, editor, or other play another role, this post is a discussion about the current state of things, some suggestions, and the challenges ahead.</p><p>Data and graphics journalism has, from its very inception, trodden the line between helping readers understand stories beyond what plain words can do without becoming too technical that only experts can understand. However, as trends change, what readers might understand or not understand changes, allowing for data and graphics teams to also push the envelope on what is a good, understandable piece of data or visual journalism.</p><h2 id="the-evolution-of-journalistic-cartography">The Evolution of Journalistic Cartography</h2><p>Ten years ago, The New York Times published <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/index.html">Snow Fall</a>, one of the earliest examples of visual storytelling on the web that would go on to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/insider/snow-fall-at-10-how-it-changed-journalism.html">win a Pulitzer Prize</a> and be widely regarded as the piece that started it all. As a college freshman at the time, I missed the publication of the piece and the resulting discourse around the report at the time, but looking back now it’s clear how far projects have come.</p><div class="video-wrap full svelte-bvrnpg"><video alt="video" src="/media/2023/01/snowfall.mp4" className="full" autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata" class="svelte-bvrnpg"></video>  </div><p>Looking back at Snow Fall now, it’s striking how much of the visual assets were simply embedded into autoplaying, looping, silent videos. Today, while video is still a common format to build visual journalism pieces off of, there has been a trend toward browser rendering or vector formats and animations for better clarity, performance, and interactivity. The 3D topographical model of the mountain as seen in Snow Fall was only possible through rendering a video back in 2012, but today it would be trivial to do something similar in mapboxgl.js for far better performance and resolution, such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/04/climate/south-asia-monsoon-climate-change.html">this piece on the Monsoons in South Asia</a>.</p><p>Design-wise, we’ve also seen maps in news stories evolve to be clearer, better labeled to fit the stories, and colors and colors more carefully picked. Extraneous details are made grayscale or monochromatic, while critical pieces of information are given colors that are bright and clear. Animations and transitions are used sparingly but effectively to draw attention to important changes or layers of a story. Words are rendered by the browser whenever possible to make text accessible and clear. Legends are obvious and intuitive to help the reader understand any special lines or arrows on the map.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-5nv82e"><img loading="lazy" alt="Ukraine Map by The New York Times" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2023/01/nytimes-ukraine-map.png" width="100%" class="svelte-5nv82e">  </div><p>Maps have also adapted to social media platforms, being exported in small, bite-sized pieces that are published to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, where there is even less room for superfluous information. It’s often difficult enough to make sure a map is legible on both desktop and mobile, let alone also optimized for each social media platform. This is where graphics teams have developed all sorts of internal tools to handle the rapid iteration of news graphics, especially when a story may need to be updated live and shared across social media.</p><h2 id="svg-and-vectors">SVG and Vectors</h2><p>One of the most important tools for making dynamic, flexible graphics and maps is to keep things in a vector format as much as possible. Most of the time, this means using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVGs (scalable vector graphics)</a> to display on webpages and mobile applications. SVGs, when rendered through an application, allow for rapid edits and updates. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, the most widely used tool for data graphics on the web, primarily works by manipulating SVG objects, including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/d3/d3-geo">powerful functions for handling projections and drawing geospatial data</a>.</p><p>SVGs are attractive due to their platform-independent compatibility, such as being able to import an SVG map directly into print tools such as Adobe Illustrator, Indesign, etc. With computers and mobile devices getting more and more powerful, having maps rendered on the client is performant and has the sharpest visual appearance.</p><p>However, the challenge for SVG maps on the web is that geospatial data is most transferred as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://geojson.org/">geojson</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/topojson/topojson">topojson</a>, which is not a particularly space-efficient format. Generating and transferring geojson files to handle a dynamic, interactive map is expensive, often resulting in files that are hundreds of megabytes, which is unacceptable for users on mobile connections.</p><p>One alternative to the geojson format that has gained popularity in recent years is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://flatgeobuf.org/">flatgeobuf</a>, a way to host a single file with complex geometries but have the client only download the geographic area it needs via http range requests, which can save a significant amount of bandwidth for large-scale interactive map experiences without the complexity of the other option: generating and hosting tiles, discussed below.</p><h2 id="map-tiles">Map Tiles</h2><p>Map tiles work by splitting up the world into square tiles based on the zoom level and coordinates, so the client downloads and renders only the tiles it needs for the map view. If you’ve used online mapping tools such as google maps and have noticed that the map tends to load in squares, those are map tiles being rendered under the hood.</p><div class="image-wrap full svelte-5nv82e"><img loading="lazy" alt="Tiles" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/media/2023/01/tiles.gif" width="100%" class="svelte-5nv82e">  </div><p>One of the early, popular libraries for implementing tiled maps is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://leafletjs.com/">leaflet</a>. Leaflet has a simple, well-documented, and extremely flexible set of tools for embedding a customizable, interactive map into a web page. Leaflet maps are still common today in many news projects. However, the go-to software stack for most web maps is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>. Mapbox allows users to host, customize, and share their own map tiles allowing so many newsrooms with fledgling graphics teams to get up and running quickly with powerful journalistic cartography.</p><p>And just as Mapbox has enabled a whole slew of journalistic cartography, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://maplibre.org/projects/">MapLibre</a> has been developing an open source version of MapboxGL as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#200">MapboxGL version 2 has transitioned to a not quite open source model</a>. The potential for new open source tools to even further transform the way that news organizations create maps is exciting. Tiling tools such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/mapbox/tippecanoe">Tippecanoe</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protomaps.com/docs/pmtiles/">PMTiles</a>, and others will continue to evolve and become part of our cartography toolkits.</p><h2 id="webgl">WebGL</h2><p>Under the hood of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/">mapboxgl.js</a> is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API">webGL</a>, a browser API that gives access to shaders that are run directly on the GPU for maximum performance in rendering to web browsers. WebGL has been used for games on the web, complex 3D modeling, and more recently cartography applications. While having all of this power to utilize the GPU allows for so much more dynamic and powerful graphics, shader code is written in a completely different paradigm than something like Javascript or Python, making it often difficult to create graphics in WebGL.</p><div class="video-wrap full svelte-bvrnpg"><video alt="video" src="/media/2023/01/webgl.mov" className="full" autoplay muted loop playsinline preload="metadata" class="svelte-bvrnpg"></video>  </div><p>So far, the most common implementation of WebGL has been these kinds of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/04/climate/south-asia-monsoon-climate-change.html">wind or weather flows</a>. But as graphics and journalistic cartography becomes an even more integral part of the newsroom workflow, I expect to see more graphics using WebGL, utilizing movement and animations for even more map detail in all sorts of areas.</p><h2 id="looking-to-2023">Looking to 2023</h2><p>As we start a new year, I’m excited to see the kinds of projects and digital cartography techniques that are published in this coming year, especially as humanity encounters climate, political, social, economic, and cultural challenges. I’m excited to continue building visualizations to accompany news stories, whether it be cartographic or otherwise.</p><p><em>Shameless plug: I am open to freelance or contract roles for this year, so if you’d like to work with me on a project, don’t hesitate to reach out!</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[A reflection on too many years on Twitter.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I honestly don’t even remember when I signed up for Twitter. At some point in my high school years I created an account, didn’t understand the point, and simply forgot about it. Back then I was far more concerned about keeping my blog, this website, up to date with random musings and incoherent brain dumps.</p><p>Blogging was my way of reaching out to the world, and reading other people’s blogs made me feel that there was a whole community of real people on the internet, even if I never reached out directly to them. The blogosphere, so to speak, was filled with creative people sharing ideas. I spent hours configuring Wordpress themes, plugins for my website, often breaking things beyond repair. Every so often I’d receive an earnest email from someone I’d never met thanking me for something I’d written in my inbox, and I would respond to every single one of those emails.</p><p>Blogging was time consuming, but it was extremely rewarding and honestly a lot of fun. But as I started focusing on my career and getting busier with day to day errands, Twitter replaced my blogging habits. Twitter was just easier, faster, and facilitated connections seamlessly. Twitter is how I got involved with Student Voice, how I got my internship at the Department of Education, how I met many of my closest friends, and how I made the decision to move to Taiwan.</p><p>In the early 2010s, social media was fun and exciting. People made accounts often without any preconceptions of what the norms were or who was looking, allowing them to be creative and genuine with what they shared. Being free of advertisements also made social media feel more like having a conversation with a close-knit group of friends in my living room rather than trying to dodge all of the overwhelming capitalist consumerism at the mall.</p><p>Instagram is no longer where I’ll post a photo of the In-n-out burger I had for lunch, knowing that an algorithm designed to maximize commercialization and controversy means that no one will ever see the post and no one will care. Facebook has gone through so many feature changes and redesigns that I don’t even know what the point is anymore.</p><p>For a while, Twitter was the only social media I used regularly that maintained support for the organic communities that made it popular in the first place: the ability to share quick ideas and meet interesting people online. But even before the recent hostile takeover in leadership, my experience on the platform changed for the worse. Senseless arguments over political issues, people and bots shilling for crypto and NFTs, and big name personalities bullying and harassing individuals started taking up more of my feed, eroding the very reason I valued Twitter in the first place.</p><p>Is social media a reflection of what everyday people around the world are experiencing? Or are the extremes on social media perpetuating a feedback loop of driving the kind genuine people off their platforms, causing the platform to become far more extreme than the world around it? What have we learned about social media from the boom and bust of the past couple decades?</p><p>So then what is the future of social media? If becoming more connected is not more better, how can we create and sustain a social media that is minimalist and effective enough to provide the amount of local and global connection that is most effective? Thinking back to blogging, the blogosphere got a lot of these elements right: things people share should require some level of effort and accountability, and as a supplement to relationships and communities that exist apart from a digital space.</p><p>But what does this mean tangibly for my personal approach to social media? For me, I want to challenge myself to use social media more intentionally rather than aimlessly. There are certain communities on specific platforms that are worth my time, and I want to continue to be a part of those. I want to seek out individuals that are offering original content and valuable ideas. For instance, I’ve found YouTube to have a wealth of solid content creators sharing very unique, original ideas.</p><p>And while I don’t expect blogging to ever return to the level of the late 2000s, I hope to write more about random ideas and things I’m learning about, even if nobody reads it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[The single page application is a flawed yet extremely useful tool for the majority of the projects that I work on.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In nearly a decade of building web applications, I’ve worked on both backend and frontend projects, using languages such a PHP, Python, and Javascript for projects ranging small independent business websites to large news applications. As Javascript single page applications have become more popular, debates over the role of client-side Javascript versus server-side applications often appear in developer communities.</p><p>Critics of SPAs will conclude that “Javascript is too bloated, slow, and complex” and opt for some kind of backend language or framework for better performance and ergonomics. I won’t rehash all the arguments in this article, but for the most part, I agree with them: client side Javascript comes with significant performance and usability drawbacks and there are strong reasons to avoid the single page application architecture.</p><p>However, I still default to single page applications often for a simple reason: the ability to avoid running any server-side code entirely. For the large majority of projects that I work on, being able to build the application out to static files that are hosted on a service like S3 is not only cheaper, but has fewer moving parts and is more reliable as an application that I might touch once every few years.</p><h2 id="the-pre-spa-era">The Pre-SPA Era</h2><p>Before the single page application, virtually every website required some sort of backend server. Whether it was Wordpress running on PHP, a django app, or even a simple rails website, it required some kind server always listening for requests before executing code to generate the HTML served to the user. This pattern became so common that it became a baseline: start with a backend server to host the website, and start building from there.</p><p>After building a few small projects this way, I started running into similar issues with every single project built this way: they would all eventually stop working simply due to the fact that they weren’t being actively maintained. Whether it was suddenly running out of disk space, software versions becoming too old, a sudden surprise hosting bill, or simply an application crash that didn’t automatically restart, it soon became a headache trying to fix an old project that hasn’t been touched in years, trying to remember how it was built in the first place.</p><p>We’ve become so accustomed to having a backend for every single website no matter how simple that we don’t think about how single page applications give us a chance to move the complexity to the browser, an environment that is generally much more careful about maintaining backwards compatibility than software systems used in backend infrastructure. The truth is, most websites out there don’t need a backend.</p><h2 id="backend-complexity-vs-frontend-complexity">Backend Complexity vs Frontend Complexity</h2><p>In my experience, engineers begin to get frustrated with single page applications when they simultaneously try to run a complicated backend as well as a single page application on the front-end. Except in larger corporate products, this is the case that I try to avoid the most.</p><p>By default, I usually begin all my projects as a single page application that gets built out to static HTML, CSS, and JS files and hosted on a simple file hosting such as S3, Google Cloud Storage, Github Pages, or some other static hosting service. This not only is the cheapest option, it also shortens development time by completely skipping most of the challenging DevOps details such as kubernetes, docker, etc. Especially if the project has no long-term maintenance or support plan, doing it this way is likely to be the most resilient option. Once deployed, simple statically hosted single page applications are much more likely to stay up and operational for years and years to come.</p><p>Building a site as a single page application without a running a backend server gives me far more room for dynamic, interactive content than the extremely limited options of the jQuery era, allowing me to go a lot further before needing to spin up a backend. In fact, I’ve built complete CMS systems as single page applications without running a backend at all. And while you may argue that running any single page application at all is worse in terms of download size, performance, or SEO, I think it’s more than appropriate of a tradeoff to have a low maintenance, cheap infrastructure. Compiled frontend frameworks like Svelte and the modern trend of static-site-generators make this even more attractive, as they optimize the performance and bundle sizes of single page applications.</p><p>But of course, there will be times where you cannot avoid running a backend. Whether it be a database requirement, a custom user authentication system, etc, many of these larger applications will require you to build an API and maybe even render some HTML. At this point, I’d argue that there may not be any strong advantages in favor of the single page application, and that a more traditional multi page application could be more suitable.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Ultimately, I see the single page application as a flawed yet extremely useful tool for the majority of the projects that I work on. So much of the debate around single page applications has assumed a backend service as a given, and thus most of the arguments have failed to weigh the pros and cons of single page applications in light of whether a backend service needs to exist at all.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Reflections on an absurd couple of years.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past two years, significant hype in the technology industry has centered around two main developments: crypto and virtual reality. With skyrocketing inflation, political unrest, racism, violence, climate change, a pandemic, wars, and so much more, people around the world are understandably disillusioned with our societal machinery and are looking for anything to come along and disrupt the status quo. Both crypto and virtual reality represent visions of leaving behind the world as we know it and creating some future that is less dependent on or completely independent from existing political, cultural, and physical systems.</p><p>I won’t make any predictions about what will emerge out of this turbulent period of history, whether anarchical systems take hold or humans find a way to fix and recover the trust in our institutions and leaders is outside my control. When humans look back at this era of human civilization, how will they talk about social media, cryptocurrencies, or our global and domestic politics?</p><p>Reading through The Atlantic’s essay on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/">uniquely stupid decade in American life</a>, I find the diagnostic of everything wrong with our society to be paralyzing. Moving back to the states after nearly three years abroad, it’s hard to describe how different things feel now, even though much of my immediate hometown feels, on the surface, identical to how I left it. My parents and the largely Asian-immigrant population in San Jose seem more on edge after violent acts toward Asians, even going so far to amplify anti-Black or anti-Mexican attitudes of the far right.</p><p>Additionally, gun violence continues to be unsolvable as children and adults are senselessly murdered in a country that somehow believes owning assault weapons is a fundamental human right, invoking debates on the second amendment, thoughts and prayers, and further inaction. As a technologist, these issues not only reveal to me what is broken about our society, but also that our problems cannot be solved through technology alone.</p><p>In the past few years, I’ve examined issues such as climate change, elections, and more from the perspective of a data journalist, crunching numbers and making graphics to better understand news events. Looking at so many disasters beyond our control has revealed to me why we feel so burnt-out, unmotivated, and defeated. Maybe the way that we’ve oriented our ambitions and careers haven’t done much to address our physical world with human-centered solutions. No matter how much we improve and advance our technology, digital tools, and internet societies, our physical world will continue to be the most important investment in our future. There’s no shortcut around investing in sustainable energy, education, public health, and civic society the way we have done for decades.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I get excited about large, ambitious visions promising big change in short time-frames as much as anyone else, but as I’ve gotten older I’ve also begun to recognize how small, often low-tech changes are the most reliable way of tangibly affecting change. Traditional institutions such as newspapers and governments, as flawed as they are, still have a lot more influence and stability than the startups and experiments of those living on the cutting edge.</p><p>That’s why I’ve decided to pursue cartography and geographic information systems in order to help better address issues including managing our land, resources, and waste. Some of the most oldest problems facing humanity include the way that we manage our land and natural resources, making the potential applications for better geospatial tools endlessly important. Geospatial visualizations provide journalists with better ways of telling news stories, especially when used in stories that explore vast amounts of data such as politics, climate change, or other socio-economic issues.</p><p>But beyond that, I’ll be looking for more ways to give back to my communities whether it be the people in my neighborhood, industry, or complete strangers, doing what I can to help others be successful.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[What is data journalism, and what role does it play in the future of the news industry?]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By any honest reflection, journalism is a messy endeavor. It’s often a mad rush to publish while accounting for the demands of our sources, readers, and editors, creating an environment where being fever-pitched is more of a norm rather than an exception. Even in my corner of the newsroom doing data and graphics for news stories, the time constraints while collecting, transforming, analyzing, visualizing, editing, and optimizing digitally-interactive reporting leaves no time for pontification. No matter how restrictive these constraints are, I also find that some of the most creative and rewarding projects come out of this difficult and challenging environment.</p><p>In 2021 alone, I’ve worked with an extremely talented, cross-functional team to do everything from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.cw.com.tw/tra-train-crash/">3D recreations of news events</a> to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.cw.com.tw/solar-2020/index.html">digital cartography</a> to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cw.com.tw/graphics/referendum-2021/">live elections</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.cw.com.tw/covid-live-updates-2021-en/">COVID</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.cw.com.tw/drought-2021-en/index.html">drought trackers</a> in the form of breaking news and investigative journalism. We’ve had to use a non-trivial amount of software tools, open source libraries, and browser APIs, many for the first time. But no matter how much we improve our practice, there is always more to learn and new techniques to use. Being in the rapid development and publish cycle of a newsroom gives us the perfect environment to try all of these new tools and technologies in creative ways.</p><p>In 2021, we’ve also received significant recognition for our projects, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cna.com.tw/project/thp_award/winners.html">winning news awards</a> and sharing our experiences with students and faculty at universities across Taiwan. The lessons and ideas discussed in this post are an adaptation of the talks I’ve given and feedback I’ve received in the past year at universities and other venues.</p><h2 id="data-visualization">Data Visualization</h2><p>But before I get to data visualization and graphics in a journalism context, I want to explore both data visualization and journalism separately, as many of our practices in data journalism are influenced by the broader context of the history as well as the current state of data, technology, and journalism. Many other industries have their own manifestations of data analysts and data visualizations, often using a very different set of tools and procedures than the ones we use in the newsroom.</p><h3 id="florence-nightingale">Florence Nightingale</h3><div class="image-wrap full svelte-5nv82e"><img loading="lazy" alt="Florence Nightingale" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2022/03/nigtingale.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-5nv82e">  </div><p>One of the earliest recorded examples of data visualization comes from the 1860s. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale">Florence Nightingale</a>, often referred to as the “founder of modern nursing”, is more often recognized for her contributions to medicine and sanitation, but Nightingale was also a statistician, social reformer, and writer.</p><p>During the Crimean War, Nightingale took care of wounded soldiers and collected data on the situation in hospitals including death rates, sanitary conditions, and more. With this data, Nightingale eschewed the standard practice of simply printing the data on a table and visualized the situation in a revolutionary new way at the time: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/florence-nightingale-data-viz-pioneer/">a radial pie chart</a>.</p><div class="image-wrap  svelte-5nv82e"><img loading="lazy" alt="Florence Nightingale's Chart" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2022/03/nightingale-chart.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-5nv82e">  </div><p>Doing so caught the attention of both fans and critics, but as a result of Nightingale’s research and publication, nursing made significant advancement toward the understanding of sanitation in healthcare, significantly reducing the mortality rate of wounded soldiers. In fact, this research would also provide grounds for improving sewage and sanitation in private homes, leading the way for significantly improved public health and sanitation. Nightingale’s work is inspiring not only because of the new visualization techniques she created, but also the impact she had on so many lives as a result of her research and publication methods.</p><h3 id="as-we-may-think">As We May Think</h3><p>In 1945, The Atlantic published <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">“As We May Think” by Vannevar Bush</a>, an American engineer with dreams for &quot;a future device for individual use ... a sort of mechanized private file and library.” Bush called this conceptual device a “Memex” and goes on to describe in rough terms the internet-connected computers and mobile devices that everyone uses today.</p><blockquote><p>“Logic can become enormously difficult, and it would undoubtedly be well to produce more assurance in its use. The machines for higher analysis have usually been equation solvers. Ideas are beginning to appear for equation transformers, which will rearrange the relationship expressed by an equation in accordance with strict and rather advanced logic. Progress is inhibited by the exceedingly crude way in which mathematicians express their relationships.”</p></blockquote><p>Bush envisioned a future where these “memex” devices would significantly reduce the trivial limitations of physical mediums to help humans think in ways more conducive to conducting research, inventing new technologies, and living healthily. Bush envisioned much of the “information society” that we find ourselves in today, and took the optimistic view that such a society would be able to better solve scientific problems and understand history.</p><div class="image-wrap  svelte-5nv82e"><img loading="lazy" alt="A visualization of the Memex" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2022/03/memex.jpg" width="500" class="svelte-5nv82e">  </div><p>Yet in other ways, the digital mediums we use today for data visualization are nowhere near the utopia that Bush dreamed of. Bret Victor talks about the still-unrealized potential that our media has on helping us <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/">think thoughts that would be otherwise unthinkable</a>, and from a bird’s eye view is the big overarching challenge to everyone who does data visualization. Giorgia Lupi, an information designer that has spent a lot of time working to humanize data, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold/">talks about this challenge</a> in a very poignant way.</p><blockquote><p>“We have to find new languages, and explore how to convey knowledge and inspire feelings simultaneously with data. We have to discover how to be faithful to scientific accuracy while allowing space for exceptions to flourish. We have to bring data to life—human life.”</p></blockquote><h3 id="d3-and-the-web">D3 and the Web</h3><p>That brings me to our modern era of data visualization on the web. In 2011, Mike Bostock released <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, an open source library for creating graphics on the web. While D3 wasn’t the first data visualization library to be created for web browsers, it’s low-level approach and direct manipulation of the document object model (DOM) in web browsers allowed it to be incredibly flexible and adaptable to any kind of chart authors wanted to create.</p><p>Linking data directly with the low-level building blocks of the DOM unlocked a huge range of user interactions and visual animation. Compared to other programming languages used for data analysis such as Python or R, Javascript suddenly became an increasingly viable and attractive tool for data visualization because of its integration with web browsers and their native APIs such as HTML, CSS, and SVG. Since then, the Javascript ecosystem has exploded with tools and libraries for data visualization, including everything from managed services such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.datawrapper.de/">Datawrapper</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> to GPU-accelerated tools such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://p5js.org/">P5</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://regl-project.github.io/regl/">Regl</a> to 3D tools such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> and so much more.</p><p>Additionally, web cartography has also experienced a renaissance of sorts. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://earth.google.com">Google Earth</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a>, two of the most established consumer digital cartography products in the internet era, have become increasingly similar as web browsers have become powerful enough to run the features that would previously only run on standalone applications such as Google Earth. The possibilities for creating complex, geographically detailed, or interactive data explorations accessible to anyone with a web browser would have been unfathomable when D3 first launched in 2011.</p><div class="image-wrap  svelte-5nv82e"><img loading="lazy" alt="ObservableHQ homepage" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2022/03/observable.png" width="100%" class="svelte-5nv82e">  </div><p>Today, Bostock is working full-time on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a>: an environment for collaborative, visual, and explanatory notebooks that run locally in the browser. The ability to browse, remix, and adapt notebooks other people have written has given individuals learning to do data visualization an easy way to publish standalone graphics and interactives. Tools like Observable are an example of the ways that web browsers continue to evolve to support new features, even if they are incremental improvements on existing technologies, rather than hype-fueled fads.</p><h2 id="journalism">Journalism</h2><p>When it comes to newsrooms, however, the transition into the digital era has not been at all smooth. In the late 2000s, a wave of digitally-native platforms arose in competition to the long-standing industry of established newspapers and magazines, followed by another wave of social media startups awakening to monetize the attention of internet users, eating away both both the discovery channels and advertising revenue of the existing media industry.</p><div class="image-wrap  svelte-5nv82e"><img loading="lazy" alt="David Carr and Vice News" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2022/03/carr-vice.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-5nv82e">  </div><p>Tech companies, media leaders, advertising companies, and internet users all had—and still have, competing visions of what journalism on the internet should look like. Vice News, one manifestation of digital-native news organizations, took a very raw and borderline sensational approach to telling stories. David Carr, the former media critic at The New York Times, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/15/business/media/15carr.html">wrote in his column</a> his observations about Vice News.</p><blockquote><p>“The company has grown to 560 employees in 30 countries, with 2,500 freelancers who are mostly paid in hipster cred. This success has created some dissonance for a crew of raconteurs who have spent much of their lives laughing at the stiffs who live pointless lives in dumb jobs defined by their next PowerPoint presentations.”</p></blockquote><p>Beneath the past two decades of media debates and debacles has ultimately been the loss of trust in media. Sensational clickbait headlines, deceptive subscription packages, partisan politicization, fake news, poor user experience, lack of cultural, gender, or racial sensitivity, sponsored content, have all contributed to the precipitous drop in the public’s journalistic trust.</p><h3 id="the-kerner-commission-50-years-later">The Kerner Commission, 50 Years Later</h3><div class="image-wrap full svelte-5nv82e"><img loading="lazy" alt="Kerner Commission" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2022/03/kerner.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-5nv82e">  </div><p>While most of these are not unique to the internet era, the internet era has made a lot of these problems a lot more apparent. Back in 1968, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/us/kerner-commission-report.html">the Kerner Commission</a> surfaced all sorts of racial injustices, including the media industry’s lack of diversity for the racial riots happening in America. Reading a report from over fifty years ago reveals how little has changed, and how many of its criticisms still ring true today.</p><blockquote><p>“the press has too long basked in a white world looking out of it, if at all, with white men’s eyes and white perspective. That is no longer good enough. The painful process of readjustment that is required of the American news media must begin now.”</p></blockquote><p>There often is a real disconnect between the lofty ideals espoused by media executives and the realities of the work being done. They tell you “Journalism is what we need to make democracy work” or “News organizations hold truth to power”, but fail to hire and retain a diverse workforce themselves. Even some of the most high-profile instances in recent years have showcased the conflicts between news executives and their workforces, such as The New York Times using shady strategies to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/01/leaked-messages-new-york-times-anti-union-strategy">prevent their technologists from unionizing</a>.</p><p>This is in addition to all the challenges that news organizations have in finding and retaining diverse talent. In an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://source.opennews.org/articles/exit-interviews-aaron-williams/">exit interview with Source</a>, Aaron Williams talks about the artificial ceiling he experienced as a data journalist, and even the shame he felt when he left The Washington Post for a job at Netflix.</p><blockquote><p>“Being labelled a ‘digital’ journalist felt like death knell to my future career aspirations. I spent large parts of my career convincing editors I was a journalist, full stop, and that the data and design aspects of my skill set aided in that endeavor.”</p></blockquote><p>Of course, journalism isn’t the only industry challenged by instances of poor management and unhealthy work cultures. However, the role of the news industry in our modern society and the lofty values espoused as a check on power lends the news industry to a higher standard and far more scrutiny, in ways that news organization need to approach with transparency and leadership. Some of the harshest scrutiny of news organizations can be found on social media, another deeply integral phenomenon of our digital era.</p><h3 id="social-media-and-seo">Social Media and SEO</h3><p>Social media has, on one hand, become vital distribution channel for news organizations, but on the other hand, left news organizations at the mercy of opaque social media algorithms whose sole purpose is to maximize engagement. When social media platforms announced a “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/was-the-medias-big-pivot-to-video-all-based-on-a-lie">pivot to video</a>” in 2015, news organizations had little choice but to follow along, forced to accept what later was revealed to be fake viewership metrics just to appease advertisers.</p><p>Even today, the relationship between social media platforms and news organizations remains tenuous at best. Also launched in 2015, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/formedia/tools/instant-articles">Facebook Instant Articles</a> is a way for Facebook to collaborate with publishers, allowing news articles to be easily and efficiently readable directly on Facebook without users ever having to leave the app or the website. Much like Facebook&#39;s push for video, instant articles has been <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/are-facebook-instant-articles-worth-it.php">largely abandoned</a>, due to the lack of results and loss of control for publishers.</p><p>Search engines, in a similar vein, have also attempted to strong-arm publishers into playing by their rules. Google released <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developers.google.com/amp/">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a> (AMP) in 2015 promising a better and faster experience for mobile users by using a customized set of amp-compatible HTML. And while AMP did in fact improve page-load times for many news articles, AMP also had scandals such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/26/google_deliberately_throttled_ad_load/">throttling non-AMP ads</a> in order to promote AMP. And as search engine optimization has taken off as its own sub-industry under marketing departments, search engine results are quickly becoming a listing of who has money to hire SEO specialists rather than who actually has the best content.</p><h3 id="the-challenge-inside-newsrooms">The Challenge Inside Newsrooms</h3><div class="image-wrap full svelte-5nv82e"><img loading="lazy" alt="Newspaper printer" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2022/03/print.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-5nv82e">  </div><p>One of the largest shifts within newsrooms, however, has been the diversification of roles and responsibilities, no longer comprised of only the journalists, editors, and photographers of yesteryear. Today, newsrooms include roles such as podcasters, video editors, project managers, designers, software engineers, cartographers, data scientists, and so many more. The scope of an entire news product has ballooned far beyond what any single person or leadership unit can possibly grasp.</p><p>This means that traditional, hierarchical management structures are ill-suited to adapt to the complexities and challenges of the modern digital journalism, especially if a newsroom has aspirations of publishing across a diversity of print, video, audio, and digital formats. The New York Times&#39; <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nytimes.com/projects/2020-report/index.html">2020 Report</a> talks about this challenge.</p><blockquote><p>“We need to become more comfortable with our photographers, videographers and graphics editors playing the primary role covering some stories, rather than a secondary role.”</p></blockquote><p>According to the recently released <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://datajournalism.com/survey/2021/">State of Data Journalism Survey</a> conducted by the European Journalism Centre, most data journalists are still siloed in their own “data units”, with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://datajournalism.com/survey/2021/work-practices/">infrequent collaboration</a> with other people in their newsrooms. Journalists are unsure how to work with technologists, often creating an environment where different factions form within newsroom, rather than playing on a diversity of skills and approaches in telling stories.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-data-and-visual-journalism">The Future of Data and Visual Journalism</h2><div class="image-wrap full svelte-5nv82e"><img loading="lazy" alt="Data Journalism Projects at Commonwealth Magazine" src="https://www.diplateevo.com/images/2022/03/data-journalism-projects.jpg" width="100%" class="svelte-5nv82e">  </div><p>With ever-advancing digital mediums and all the challenges facing journalism, there is a significant opportunity to rethink our relationship with news, especially given the world of data that we live in. From a data and technology perspective, there has never been a better time to do journalism, only limited by how we adapt and use more data and technology in our reporting. This is not to say we ignore the lessons of the previous era of physical media, but rather how we build upon the lessons of the past using the tools of the present, in close collaboration with traditional journalists and editors.</p><p>Over the past two years, we’ve seen the COVID-19 story create a whole new class of long-lived data journalism projects that have challenged the traditional notion of what a story is. How a project gets updated, edited, and shared has now become an important consideration for large-scale projects that aim to help readers understand a situation. This model can be extended to other areas to help the public better understand nuances of natural phenomena, government policies, social phenomena, climate change, economic cycles, and so much more.</p><p>This is an exciting shift in journalism because it helps organizations report news beyond units of stories or articles, allowing news organizations to better capture and track long-running stories and trends. Another benefit of doing so is helping readers become more familiar with data-driven approaches, allowing interactive visualizations to serve both explanatory and exploratory roles.</p><h3 id="big-macs-and-open-data">Big Macs and Open Data</h3><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index">Big Mac Index</a> by The Economist is also a great example of this kind of long-running data journalism project. Invented in 1986 as a “lighthearted guide to whether currencies are at their ‘correct’ level”, the Big Mac Index has been quoted in numerous academic studies due to how easy it is to understand and digest. Additionally, the data behind the Big Mac Index, is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data">available on Github</a> under an open source MIT license, freely available for anyone to use for any purpose.</p><p>Releasing open data to the public is another way of sharing stories in our digital society. News organizations have the opportunity to not only look for data to tell stories with, but also the opportunity to be contributors of data. A few examples of this include The Washington Post releasing data on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/">police shootings in the US</a>, The New York Times making <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">COVID datasets public</a>, or ProPublica’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/">Congress API</a>.</p><p>I believe that, if done responsibly, data journalism can play a significant role in helping restore the public’s trust in media. By making data public and contributing to the world of open data, news organizations can also help bolster public trust, transparency, and data literacy. Despite the fact that only a small subset of readers may download the data themselves, releasing data ultimately allows for greater accountability within the stories we are reporting on.</p><h3 id="the-digital-newsroom">The Digital Newsroom</h3><p>This is not to say that visual, web-based journalism is the only innovation happening in the journalistic sense. Podcasts are reaching audiences that traditional words and pictures have been unable to reach, creating a whole new segment and conventions around telling stories through audio. Online video journalism, despite Facebook’s “pivot to video” scam of last decade, is still a viable and growing area. There are synergies yet to be explored between all of these differing mediums of journalism and fully realized in reporting.</p><p>Experimentation, prototyping, and rapid feedback loops are vital parts of successful digital newsrooms. Just as journalists must often adapt to the specific circumstances of a political system, industry, or environment in order to properly and ethically report on it, newsrooms must learn to be flexible enough to adapt to the trends in technology and readership in order to better tell stories. Mediums such as virtual or augmented reality, video games, social media, are all potential areas to be carefully considered and experimented with in future iterations of news products.</p><p>In conclusion, it’s easy to become infatuated with the pace new technologies are being developed and deployed, but news organizations need to remain focused on their north star of telling stories that matter using data, visuals, or other multimedia when it strengthens stories. News organizations have the opportunity to play a larger role in making data more accessible and transparent to the public, while simultaneously working to improve data literacy as much as possible. It’s a challenge that will continue to be messy and challenging to manage, but I believe that newsrooms can continue to be vital institutions of leadership and innovation.</p>]]></content:encoded>
